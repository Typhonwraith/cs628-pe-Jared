Input

The user provides their resume information by hard coding it into a React component. This file, Resume.js, has JavaScript that tells the application what the data is and how to structure it. 

Process

The application runs using React's virtual DOM to update the UI. It renders the data using the input from the user. It transforms it from code and css styling in a way that is easy to read for the user.
The JavaScript file, Resume.js, uses classes to enhance formatting by referencing the Resume.css file which contains css code. This code, broken into classes, allows the JavaScript file to use each class multiple times. This makes formatting more efficient and easier to manage through styling.

Output

After compiling and running npm start in the terminal, the program displays the information, structure, formatting, and styling, in a browser. The program updates the browser with any style or structural changes automatically as they're input.
